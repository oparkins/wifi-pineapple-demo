      <h2>ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY (AUP)</h2>

      <h4><strong>FOR YOUR SUPERCOMPUTING CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION</strong></h4>

      <p>As a participant in the Supercomputing Challenge, you may have access
        to a high performance computer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
        other sites and to the Internet. Use of these facilities is a PRIVILEGE,
        and you MUST act in a responsible and ethical way at all times.</p>

      <p>Through these facilities, you will be able to access information on
        computer systems around the world. Supercomputing Challenge participants,
        their parents, and their schools must understand that the Supercomputing
        Challenge sponsors and their employees have NO control over the access
        to specific systems or the content of information on any system. Some
        systems may contain material that may not be appropriate for students.
        All Supercomputing Challenge sponsors ban the use of inappropriate
        materials on their own computing systems, and its use by Supercomputing
        Challenge participants is strictly prohibited. Parents of Participants
        are asked to monitor home use of the computer systems.</p>

      <p>Supercomputing Challenge participants are encouraged to seek help
        for their projects through network contacts. However, the information,
        opinions, advice, and services provided via the Supercomputing Challenge
        computing and networking systems are those of the provider and not of
        the Supercomputing Challenge.</p>

        array of computing facilities and information. You can get technical
        support from the Supercomputing Challenge Consulting team at: (505)
