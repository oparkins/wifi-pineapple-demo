  <h1 align="center">Supercomputing Challenge Awards</h1>
  <p>In addition to being an educational experience, the Challenge is a
  competition. It is designed to encourage students to perform at the
  highest possible level. While we recognize that many first-time
  participants may feel as though they cannot compete with more
  experienced students, there are many levels of recognition that can
  be attained for participants of all levels.</p>
  <p>As the year goes on, we continue to solicit awards from various
  sponsors so this list will probably change by April.</p>

<!-- NM EPSCoR can offer an award for the best project related to water 
           resources in NM and/or climate change impacts on water.  Either me or 
           Natalie could make the presentation of the award; but we'd want your 
           judges to make the decision.  We'd give $150 per student on the 
           winning team. We cannot give you the cash in advance, however.  We 
           will have to get the students' names and info and send them checks 
           after the fact.  It generally only takes a couple weeks.

      member a CD of our booklet &quot;Careers: Exploring the

      a NMNWSE book bag, and an NMNWSE award certificate. NMNWSE is

> So, yes, we would like to give both of these awards again.  And yes, we would like the judges to choose, although input from Consult to the judges would be appreciated, to provide background on which teams meet the criteria and any backstory info that would should be considered. Our original premise was to give both our awards to teams rather than teachers....they could be given to both teacher and team, but include the kids.
> 
> The Magellan award was conceived as recognizing a team/individual who best exemplified  "getting out of the shallow end" (inspired by the book) ... good candidates might include teams from  a school which newly established a computer science class, or who enters a SCC team from that school for the first time.  But the concept was not just a team that barely finished, but the team from that category that did the -best- job...maybe even made the finalists but not the top three.  So not a consolation prize, but a 'wow you didn't quite make it to the top 3 but you did a great job"  We do agree that prizes should be spread out so if a team from that category placed then it could go to the next team down.  But that's why the judges need to be involved and the winner not picked prior to the Expo or Finalist judging.  The team need not be newcomers - maybe they've done the challenge before but really picked up the skill level.
> 
> The Newcomer Award should also go to a team that performed well but not -quite- enough to receive a regular award, but in this case a team with members who were all new to the Challenge. But just like the above award, it should be a team that did a great job, but not quite enough to win another significant award.
> 
> So the judges need a list from Consult of teams that meet the criteria for each of these...our suggestion would be that they choose the other awards without that information, and then choose these two awards last, so that the information doesn't skew the their choices. Then they can say, well Team X was really good but didn't quite make the cut for a prize and they are the top performing team on this list. Or Team Y was on the list but they were so great that they won 2nd place (like Rachel and Jessie's team were newcomers) so don't give them the Newcomer as well, pick the next best team that didn't win something.  It might be a team that moved up to Finalist after the Expo judging but didn't place in the top 3.
> 
> Hope that helps with understanding the criteria. We can write up something to give the judges as well.  I don't know if I'll make it to Expo this year but you could always buttonhole Bob that day if the decision needs input.
> 
> Thanks
