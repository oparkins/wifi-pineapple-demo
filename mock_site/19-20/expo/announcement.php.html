<p>The deadline for<!-- <a href="registration.php">-->registering online<!--</a>--> is
April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020.</p>

<p>Each person who attends the Expo activities must

be completed.
We also need an accurate count of those attending so that we can organize
the program, the housing, and order the food.</p>

<p>Teachers are responsible for supervision of the students.</p>

<h2>Expo</h2>
<!--
<img src="lanlresearchlib.jpg" align="LEFT" border="4pt"> The Expo will take place in the
Research Library and Study Center at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory's TA-3 site (see the
<a href="directions.html">detailed map</a>).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, April 27<sup>th</sup>, each team will be assigned a half-hour
time slot between 8:30 and 11:30
to present their project to a set of judges.  In addition to the poster
display, a (laptop) computer can be used during the presentation.
<!--<a href="laptops.php">If you are bringing a laptop, make sure you understand these requirements.</a>
After the teams present their projects, they should get ready to go on
tours of the Laboratory (quickly return valuable items and items not
allowed on the tours to their vehicles). After lunch the tours will
continue and will visit several different Laboratory sites to learn
about the ongoing research at Los Alamos.</p>
-->
<p>
The Awards Ceremony is on Tuesday, April 28<sup>th</sup> from 9:00 to
12:00 in the TBD <!--Church of Christ--> Auditorium 
<!--(see the <a href="directions.html">detailed

<h2>Tour Information </h2>
<!--
<p>Everyone must bring a picture ID because you will have to present it to
take the tours.  A driver's license or student picture ID is adequate. 
If you do not have a driver's license, you can have a picture ID made at
the Department of Motor Vehicles.  If we have your picture from the Kickoff,
that will do, but bring a picture ID just in case.</p>

<p>There can be NO last-minute substitutions; only those students and
teachers whose names have been sent in may attend the Laboratory tours
that go inside the security area.</p>

<p>Only US citizens will be allowed on the tours inside the security area,
but foreign national students may participate in the parts of the tours that are
outside of the security area. </p>

<p>Teams wanting to go on the tours together MUST go through the registration
line together. Tours will take place from 10:00 to 5:00 on Monday.</p>

<p>The following articles are <b>PROHIBITED</b> inside the security area:
<ul>
<li> Firearms, other dangerous or deadly weapons, explosives, incendiary &
     explosive devices. (This include pocket knives with blades longer than
     2.5 inches.) <em> So leave your big knives, leather-mans, and such at
     home or in the car/bus.</em></li>
<li> Privately owned recording equipment (audio, video, optical, or data).
     <em> So leave your cameras, mp3 players, flash drives, etc in the car/bus.</em></li>
<li> Privately owned electronic equipment with a data exchange part capable
     of being connected to automated information systems equipment.</li>

Safety is very important at Los Alamos National Laboratory. If you see
something that you feel is unsafe while at the Laboratory, report it
to the group escorts or to the Supercomputing Challenge coordinators.</p>

comfortable shoes.  Bring a jacket or sweater because weather
can unexpectedly turn cold and rainy or snowy.  <b>Please dress nicely</b>.
<!--Bring your swimming suit if you would like to go swimming in the evening
at the Larry R. Walkup Aquatic Center in Los Alamos.--></p>

<h2>Lodging</h2>
<p>Details posted later. <!--Lodging will be available in Los Alamos Sunday and Monday evenings
for Expo registrants from more than 120 miles from Los Alamos and on
Monday evening for Expo registrants living between 60 and 120 miles
from Los Alamos.--></p>

<p>The Supercomputing Challenge will pay for room (one or two nights at hotel
and breakfast included); any other lodging charges
will be your responsibility.  <b>Note that you will possibly share a
room with people from other teams</b> (students will be placed four to a room
and teachers two to a room). <!--Participants will be housed at
